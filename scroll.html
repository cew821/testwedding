			<p>May 12, 2013 was a sunny spring day, so we decided to pack some sandwiches and bike to Great Falls for a picnic. Charles offered to pack the lunches and carry the bag, and he slipped in some extra cargo while Jess wasn't looking.</p>

      <p>At the falls we found a quiet rock by the water to eat our PB&Js. As we watched the waterfall, Jess told Charles how much she loved their adventures. Suddenly, Jess realized Charles was down on one knee with a ring in his hand. He told her he was excited for a lifetime of adventures together, and asked if she would like to marry him...</p>
