			<p>May xx, 2013 was a sunny spring day, so we decided to pack some sandwiches and bike to Great Falls for a pick nick. Charles offered to pack the lunches and carry the bag, and he slipped in some extra cargo while Jess wasn't looking.</p>
			<p>When we got to the Falls, we sat on this rock where we ate our PB&Js. Jess had just gotten through telling Charles how much she loved the adventures we have together when she noticed that Charles was down on one knee with a ring in his hand. He told her he was excited for a lifetime of adventures together, and she said 'Yes!'</p>
